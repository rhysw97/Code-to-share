How can I save to sql data base
create a data base with (name, amount, price, category)
functions to add things to the data base

I want the variants to read from a database and then store all the information inside of them
Well first I want my user to be able to enter a pass word to get to the owner options

Then I want them to be able to enter a price a  stock amount and a name and a category which gets added to a variant. 
all input will be checked
That variant will then get written into the data base when the stock is exited
